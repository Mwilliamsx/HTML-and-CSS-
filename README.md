## Apple Cinemas

This website serves as an illustration of a home page for an Apple Retailer Store that offers support for Macbooks and is stylized with Bootsrap 4. Numerous Bootstrap elements are present, such as a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdown menus.

## Return of The 1's 

This page is an example home page for a Sneaker Store selling Exclusive Air Jordan 1's. It's styled using CSS and contains a nav-bar, image containers and a form.
